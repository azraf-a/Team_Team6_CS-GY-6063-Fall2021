# Guidelines

## Git/Github
1. **Pull** `develop` before you create a new branch from it
2. Name new branches after the issue you are working on.  Eg, `issue23`.
3. If you want to divide the tasks for work on an issue into multiple branches, append an underscore and the name the task.  Eg, `issue23_fix_urls`.
4. When working on your own branch, **pull before you push**
5. Never merge your own code into other branches.  Always create a pull request and get a teammate to review.
6. Open pull requests **early** and **push often**
