### http://localhost:8000/resources/days/admin -> will show day_list admin has

### http://localhost:8000/resources/days/admin/2 -> will show the day detail of this day

### http://localhost:8000/resources/days/2 -> I want this to display the day detail indead of the upper one.

However, The detail_of_day should not be under /days/admin/2, but /days/2.\
I dont know where went wrong with my views.\
Please check for improvement.
